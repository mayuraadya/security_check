# security_check
Adding security check of codebase to QMS pipeline

## Purpose
This action will scan the codebase for security vulnerabilities and report the findings to the QMS pipeline as an artifact.

## Inputs
The following inputs are required for the action to run:
- Snyk API Key. This is the API key for the Snyk account that will be used to scan the codebase for vulnerabilities. This should preferably be stored as a repository secret.

## Outputs
The following outputs are generated by the action:
- Snyk test results. This is the result of the Snyk test that was run on the codebase.
    Codes are:
        0: success (scan completed), no vulnerabilities found
        1: action_needed (scan completed), vulnerabilities found
        2: failure, try to re-run command
        3: failure, no supported projects detected
  Result codes are annotated to the action
- Snyk test report. This is the report of the Snyk test that was run on the codebase. The report will be saved as an artifact in the QMS pipeline.

## Usage
To use the action, add the following to the QMS pipeline:
```yaml
- name: Security Check
  uses: nn-dma/security_check@main
  with:
    SnykToken: ${{ secrets.SNYK_API_KEY }}
```
